## 💡 About Me

I am a Data Analytics and Machine Learning fresher with strong hands-on experience in solving real-world business problems using data.

While I do not have formal industry experience yet, I have independently built multiple end-to-end analytics projects simulating real business environments — including fintech transaction analysis, airline performance dashboards, retail intelligence systems, and predictive machine learning models.

My focus is not just building models, but understanding business problems and delivering data-driven insights.
